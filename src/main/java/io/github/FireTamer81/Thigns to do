Things that need Fixing:

	The custom overlay is not being used, and even if it was I do not know how it would be colored in the same way as the fluid.
	I think I can use one of the "EntityViewRenderEvent" in place of the overlay texture.
	
	When attempting to pick the fluid up wiht a bucket it just deletes that instance without change the bucket item.
	
	Using the custom Bucket Item to place the fluid does not play an empty sound.
