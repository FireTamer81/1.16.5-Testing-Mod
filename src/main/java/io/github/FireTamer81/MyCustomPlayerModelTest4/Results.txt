Still can't figure out how to add a texture to the model, and it is still rotated weirdly.

From what I can tell of the way Entities are normally rendered, the Renderer class never calls the model
render method as the two are joined in the Entity Type Registry (or something similar, can't remember the name).

Tried doing that, but I couldn't figure out how to do a "dummy entity" or bind the Entity Type (or whatever it was in tutorials) in that way.
