Things that need Fixing:

	The custom overlay is not being used, and even if it was I do not know how it would be colored in the same way as the fluid.
	I can use an event to create a custom colored fog when inside the custom fluid, but I can't control the transparency/density of it which causes a headache when going into it.
	
	When attempting to pick the fluid up with a bucket it just deletes that instance without change the bucket item.
	
	Using the custom Bucket Item to place the fluid does not play an empty sound.
